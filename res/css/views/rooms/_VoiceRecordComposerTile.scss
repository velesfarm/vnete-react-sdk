// The keyframes are slightly weird here to help make a ramping/punch effect
// for the recording dot. We start and end at 100% opacity to help make the
// dot feel a bit like a real lamp that is blinking: the animation ends up
// spending a lot of its time showing a steady state without a fade effect.
// This lamp effect extends into why the 0% opacity keyframe is not in the
// midpoint: lamps take longer to turn off than they do to turn on, and the
// extra frames give it a bit of a realistic punch for when the animation is
// ramping back up to 100% opacity.
//
// Target animation timings: steady for 1.5s, fade out for 0.3s, fade in for 0.2s
// (intended to be used in a loop for 2s animation speed)
